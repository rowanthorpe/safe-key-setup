BIG FAT WARNING
===============

This is a thrown together prototype at the moment. A test run did *for me* do
all the things it promises to do, but due to the highly risky nature of what
this does I will still stubbornly consider it ALPHA until many of my peers have
audited, criticised, ridiculed, insulted, and wrangled any bugs out of it...

Therefore, this README is completely unhelpful for now, to discourage anyone
trying to use it in the real world, and complaining when it shreds their
existing keyring and serves it up to them in a white wine sauce.

If you are still reading (perhaps you are a friend I pointed you here to help
me improve it), then please read the source for clues, and if you do test-run
it please do so on a throwaway keyring, etc...
