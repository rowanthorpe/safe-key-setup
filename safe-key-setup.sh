## safe-key-setup

####
# Creates a full-strength GPG keypair with a sub-key for encryption, optional multiple sub-keys
# for signing, optionally signs the key with specified existing keys, optionally imports a
# specified image, creates a revocation cert, backs up the master secret key and removes it from
# the main keyring (so it can be kept separate from the public master and subkeys, for use only
# when necessary).
####

# NB:
#
# * I only had time to throw this together enough to "work for me". I know there are things that
#   still need ironing out, but my free-time is a bit sporadic at the moment. However I would love
#   this tool to become generally useful and would really appreciate any feedback, bug-reports and
#   patches. Particularly I want this to be paranoically safe - I have already used a weird hack
#   with a foregrounded memlockd to avoid swappable memory but haven't yet worked out how to
#   (temporarily disable?) avoid computer hibernation storing passwords to disk. Thanks.
#
# * Deliberately using same Full Name field and no Comment fields for all UIDs. When making a strong master
#   key there should be no ambiguity about the name, and comments are almost alway used wrongly (which
#   confuses things later) and are almost never actually needed (the few who do should edit them manually).
#
# * Deliberately not offering to upload it to a keyserver at the end - I presently think that is
#   just too risky in an automated script and shouldn't be encouraged. If you think I should change
#   my mind please email me and give me your reasoning...

# FIXME:
#
#       [straight-forward stuff]
#
# * Make all code tolerate filenames with embedded space (this will introduce lots of evals
#   though...).
#
# * Set the password from the moment the key is created (so there is no window of vulnerability)
#   and pipe the password in for all steps using $HIDDEN_PRINTF.
#
# * Redirect this script's STDIN to /dev/null so any entropy assistance (typing) during keys'
#   creation won't be inserted later as gibberish when trying to save the key.
#
# * Use and respect gpg lock files (e.g. secring.gpg.lock, etc), for obvious reasons.
#
# * Manually audit this script and confirm each gpg invocation is inputting exactly the expected
#   sequence of text.
#
#       [not so simple stuff]
#
# * Work out if there is any way to avoid using hibernatable memory (or disable hibernation
#   during this script).
#
#       [can only be improved in gpg, not here -> heads-up gpg devs...!]
#
# * At present GPG's batch generation capability is not mature, so this script necessarily reverts
#   to hackish, not-future-proof, fragile "faked input" in some places. The only proper solution
#   to this is to improve GPG though.
#
# * It is only possible to specify one subkey during automated key creation, so the extra subkeys,
#   etc have to be added via an extra step. The "proper way" is for the GPG developers to extend its
#   batch generation facility for [A] multiple subkeys during key generation, and [B] adding subkeys
#   to existing keys, etc.

# TODO:
#
#       [when I have time]
#
# * Add "set -e" to the top of the script and check that every command is failproofed
#
#       [to decide if wise first]
#
# * Perhaps automate updating trustdb (configurably), after all other actions are done.
